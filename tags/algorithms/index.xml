      <description>Prompt The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n=2 and n=3.</description>

      <description>What is a backtracking algorithm? An algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally one piece at a time, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (the time elapsed till reachign any level of the search tree).
It works incrementally.
Think of SudoKu!  To solve SudoKu, we fill digits one by one. When the current digit we added doesn&amp;rsquo;t lead to a solution, we remove it = backtrack We try another digit.</description>

      <description>Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Recommendation Algorithms Overview  Recommendation algorithms are at the core of the Netflix product. They provide our members with personalized suggestions to reduce the amount of time and frustration to find something great content to watch. Because of the importance of our recommendations, we continually seek to improve them by advancing the state-of-the-art in the field. We do this by using the data about what content our members watch and enjoy along with how they interact with our service to get better at figuring out what the next great movie or TV show for them will be.</description>
