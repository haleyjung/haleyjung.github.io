      <description>Prototype Chains  A mechanism for making objects that resemble other objects. Makes one object behave as if it has the same properties of another object by delegating its failed property lookups to that other object at lookup time. Prototype chains make it possible for many child objects to all reflect the properties of one parent object. We can use a prototype object to store all the shared methods and make all our instance objects delegrate to that prototype object, rather than copying all the methods references over.</description>

      <description>Decorator Pattern var Car = function (loc) { var obj = { loc: loc }; ob.mov = function() { // Decorator pattern: creates a new function for every function call  obj.loc++; }; }; var amy = Car(1); amy.move(); var ben = Car(9); ben.move(); Functional Class Pattern with Shared Methods &amp;hellip;or Functional-Shared Pattern
var Car = function (loc) { var obj = { loc: loc }; ob.mov = move; return obj; }; var move = function() { this.</description>

      <description>What is this?  An identifier for values Designed to support object oriented programming  Binding When a method or constructor function is invoked, this binds to a likely-focal object, so that we can easily access that object.
this is not bound to&amp;hellip; var fn = function (a, b) { log(this); // what is this NOT bound to? };   The function object: {f}
  An instance of the function it appears within: {}</description>

      <description>Function Expression vs. Function Declaration The function name can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions while function declarations (statements) require names.
A function expression can be used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).
//Function Expression let variableName = function() { statements; }; // -&amp;gt; ends with a semicolon because it&amp;#39;s an assignment statement; not part of the function syntax  //Function Declaration function name([param[, param,[..., param]]]) { statements; } Definition of IIFE IIFE, also known as Self-Executing Anonymous Function, is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.</description>

      <title>Function Call vs Function Invocation</title>

      <guid>https://haleyjung.github.io/posts/2022/01/function-call-vs-function-invocation/</guid>
      <description>Function Call  Directly telling the function to run. The combined process of fully applying the function then invoking it, usually with the added semantic that the code will wait for a return value.  Function Invocation  i.e. Function got executed. Indirectly refers to the calling statement. The process required to schedule the function with its fully bound arguments for execution. Includes pushing arguments onto the stack and transferring the PC to the new address, placing messages/objects/functions/thunks on a queue for later execution or various other RPC systems.</description>

      <description>Definition  DOM: Document Object Model An object-based representation of the source HTML document An interface to web pages; an API to the page  Functions  Allows browsers to determine what to render in the viewport Allows JavaScript to manipulate the page&amp;rsquo;s content, structure, and styles  DOM vs. HTML DOM is not HTML. It is an interface to valid HTML documents. They differ from one another for a number of reasons:</description>

      <title>Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types</title>

      <guid>https://haleyjung.github.io/posts/2022/01/primitive-and-non-primitive-data-types/</guid>
      <description>Definitions Data Type There is a variety of data types, such as number, boolean, string, null, undefined, etc.
Primitive Data Type  Numbers Strings Booleans undefined null  Primitives are stored by value.
Every time a new variable is declared using a primitive data type, a new address in memory is created for that value.
let a = 1; let b = a;  a has value of 1, which is a Number, a Primitive data type.</description>

      <description>Definition  CDN is a group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by caching contents in proxy servers near to the user&amp;rsquo;s physical location. Leads to a faster and high performance of activities such as watching a movie, downloading a software, checking a bank balance, posting on social media, and making a transaction.  Purpose  Users experience a consistent, faster, and high performance web application.</description>

      <description>Lexical Scopes The part of a program where a binding between a variable and value is valid (variables are only available under certain circumstances with different languages having different access rules).
 Describes the regions in my code where I can refer to a variable by name without getting access errors. Defining a function creates a new lexical scope It is a collection of key-value pairs, but is not an object - except the global context object.</description>
