      <description>JSON: JavaScript Object Notation JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.
JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function, and is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object. It is thus faster and easier than XML.
To read from JSON, we need to first use fs to read in the file as text(strings) and then `JOSN.</description>

      <description>Definition Recursion is a technique for solving problems wherein a function makes calls to itself. By doing so, it can complete a small amount of the processing, and delegate the rest of the problem to the recursive calls.
Recursive function always come with a function inside. With 2 minimum cases inside: a base case, and a recursive case. The base case is the situation or condition where we don&amp;rsquo;t need to recursively invoke the function and is safe to assume that that function can end easily.</description>

      <description>Cloning Twitter using jQuery &amp;amp; NodeJS Goal The goal of the Twitter clone project was to create a single page that generates live user feeds. I used jQuery to create HTML elements and functions to make them dynamic.
Wireframe I began with drawing various wireframes to organize the structure of the overall layout and individual components. The first wireframe was a rough design to indicate the overall layout that was going to be created using CSS Grid.</description>

      <description>CSS Grid Layout is great for creating a responsive web page layout.
We can also define an area by giving it a name and then specify the location of that area in the value of the grid-template-areas property, such as:
 header footer sidebar content  The grid-area property can be assigned to a class:
.header { grid-area: hd; } .footer { grid-area: ft; } .content { grid-area: main; } .</description>

      <description>Prototype Chains  A mechanism for making objects that resemble other objects. Makes one object behave as if it has the same properties of another object by delegating its failed property lookups to that other object at lookup time. Prototype chains make it possible for many child objects to all reflect the properties of one parent object. We can use a prototype object to store all the shared methods and make all our instance objects delegrate to that prototype object, rather than copying all the methods references over.</description>

      <description>What is this?  An identifier for values Designed to support object oriented programming  Binding When a method or constructor function is invoked, this binds to a likely-focal object, so that we can easily access that object.
this is not bound to&amp;hellip; var fn = function (a, b) { log(this); // what is this NOT bound to? };   The function object: {f}
  An instance of the function it appears within: {}</description>

      <description>Function Expression vs. Function Declaration The function name can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions while function declarations (statements) require names.
A function expression can be used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).
//Function Expression let variableName = function() { statements; }; // -&amp;gt; ends with a semicolon because it&amp;#39;s an assignment statement; not part of the function syntax  //Function Declaration function name([param[, param,[..., param]]]) { statements; } Definition of IIFE IIFE, also known as Self-Executing Anonymous Function, is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.</description>

      <title>Function Call vs Function Invocation</title>
      <link>https://haleyjung.github.io/posts/2022/01/function-call-vs-function-invocation/</link>

      <guid>https://haleyjung.github.io/posts/2022/01/function-call-vs-function-invocation/</guid>
      <description>Function Call  Directly telling the function to run. The combined process of fully applying the function then invoking it, usually with the added semantic that the code will wait for a return value.  Function Invocation  i.e. Function got executed. Indirectly refers to the calling statement. The process required to schedule the function with its fully bound arguments for execution. Includes pushing arguments onto the stack and transferring the PC to the new address, placing messages/objects/functions/thunks on a queue for later execution or various other RPC systems.</description>
