      <description>What is a path? A path is a string of characters that identify a specific location of a file or folder on computer. In another word, it represents the directory and file relationship in the operating system. The characters seperated with a slash in URLs represent a path. From this we can also grasp that a path is essential for constructing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). A path is either absolute or relative.</description>

      <description>I can no longer remember how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve created this very same file due to various errors and deployment failures.
But, I love debugging! Coming from a field where subjectivity defines the output, I&amp;rsquo;m in love with coding that always has some form of solution.
With that, this shall be my first &amp;lsquo;final&amp;rsquo; post.</description>

      <description>Hi!
Today I Learned is a collection of my spark and struggle.
⭐ ⭐ ⭐
When I came across a blog that publish articles on daily learnings
while scrolling through a slack community of software engineers,
I immediately knew this is going to be my next mini project!</description>
